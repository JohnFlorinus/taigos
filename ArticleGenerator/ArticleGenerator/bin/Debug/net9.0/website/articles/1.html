                **Key Developments in Finance and Economics**

The $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visas has sent shockwaves through corporate America, particularly in the tech industry, which relies heavily on the program to bring in skilled workers from abroad. The move is expected to impact the industry's ability to attract and retain talent.

A recent survey found that 48% of Americans are struggling to make ends meet, with many relying on credit cards to cover unexpected expenses. The survey also revealed that 71% of Americans have no savings, highlighting the need for financial planning and emergency funds.

The 10-year Treasury yield has risen to a two-week high, sparking concerns about the impact on long-term interest rates, including those on mortgages. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has risen to a two-week high, making bonds a more attractive option for investors seeking income.

The S&P 500 has reached record highs, but some analysts warn that the rally may be due for a correction, citing historical trends and market sentiment. Investors are rushing back to big tech stocks, despite concerns about the market's volatility.

The US economy has seen a slowdown in growth, with the median household income rising by just 1% in 2024. However, some cities are seeing faster growth, with four of the top five cities being in California.

The coffee industry has been hit hard by tariffs, with prices expected to rise even further due to the US-China trade war. The US government has announced plans to cut interest rates, which is expected to have a positive impact on the economy, but some analysts warn that the move may not be enough to stimulate growth, citing concerns about inflation and the trade deficit.

However, others caution that the market is highly volatile and may be due for a correction.
