                The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates for the first time in over a decade, sparking a mixed reaction in the stock market. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to a two-week high, while the S&P 500 Index fell 0.2%. The rate cut is seen as a sign of the Fed's efforts to stimulate economic growth, but it has also raised concerns about inflation and the potential for a housing market bubble.

The rate cut has led to a surge in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin rising 5% and Ethereum gaining 4%. This increase is attributed to the expectation that the Fed's rate cut will lead to increased liquidity in the financial system and a decrease in interest rates, making it more attractive for investors to put their money into cryptocurrencies.
